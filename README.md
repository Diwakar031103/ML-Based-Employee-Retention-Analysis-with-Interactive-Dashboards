## ML-Based-Employee-Retention-Analysis-with-Interactive-Dashboards

* Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze employee retention trends across departments.
  
* Identified key factors affecting retention, such as work accidents, project load, promotions, and satisfaction levels.

* Explored critical HR metrics, such as work accidents (15K+ cases), project workload (57K+ projects), and promotions (319 in the last 5 years) to assess their impact on retention.
  
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing trends in employee satisfaction, work hours, and performance evaluations to uncover patterns.

* Built a Machine Learning model using Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression to predict employee attrition with high accuracy.
  
* Processed and visualized HR data using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for insights.
  
* Preprocessed data using Label Encoding, Train-Test Splitting, and optimized model performance using feature engineering.
  
* Evaluated models using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Reports to select the best-performing approach.
  
* Achieved high prediction accuracy and provided data-driven recommendations to reduce employee turnover.
